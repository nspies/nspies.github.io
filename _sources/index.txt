biorpy documentation
********************

Introduction
============

biorpy is a python package devoted to making it easier to access the power of R directly from python. biorpy sits as a conversion layer on top of the popular rpy2, and simplifies a number of standard tasks. Its features include:

1. transparent conversion to and from pandas and numpy data formats
2. default arguments for standard, built-in functions that might otherwise behave erratically when called using rpy2
3. additional functions for standard plots used in biology, such as plotting multiple lines on the same plot with a legend
