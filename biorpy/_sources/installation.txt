Installation
************

biorpy requires the following packages to be installed:

- `rpy2 <http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-2.3/html/>` (which requires R)
- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`
- `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`

Installation of biorpy itself can be accomplished as for most typical python packages::

    python setup.py install

Additional standard options are documented `here <https://docs.python.org/2/install/>`.

An excellent place to start (and which will also serve to test you installation) is to run the ``examples.py`` script file included with the distribution. The output is by default placed in a pdf in the current working directory.
